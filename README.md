This repository relates to the subject called Geographical Project, which is taught at the Faculty of Science, Charles University. Everything is about making use of the Google Earth Engine API through the {rgee} package. In the scripts, it is explained how to upload a simple feature as an asset, and the power of reducers is shown either with image collections with continuous variables or with image collections with categorical variables. The examples are exclusively given when using the polygon representing the catchment of the Mile≈°ov Brook.
